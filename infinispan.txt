Infinispan is a distributed cache and key-value NoSQL data store software developed by Red Hat. Java applications can embed it as library, use it as a service in WildFly[1] or any non-java applications[2] can use it as remote service through TCP/IP.[3]
In computing, a distributed cache is an extension of the traditional concept of cache used in a single locale. A distributed cache may span multiple servers so that it can grow in size and in transactional capacity. It is mainly used to store application data residing in database and web session data. The idea of distributed caching[1] has become feasible now because main memory has become very cheap and network cards have become very fast, with 1 Gbit now standard everywhere and 10 Gbit gaining traction.[when?] Also, a distributed cache works well on lower cost machines usually employed for web servers as opposed to database servers which require expensive hardware.[2] An emerging internet architecture known as Information-centric networking (ICN) is one of the best examples of a distributed cache network. The ICN is a network level solution hence the existing distributed network cache management schemes are not well suited for ICN.[3] In the supercomputer environment, distributed cache is typically implemented in the form of burst buffer.
